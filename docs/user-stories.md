## Brainstorming

### Teacher's View

        + IDEA: assume that it wasn't registered by mistake and its address ends with the appropriate domain.
            + "You don't seem to have been registered, click here to issue a report to the institution"
            + Institution administrator gets notified and proceeds to register/validate the teacher manually.
    + Teacher writes institutional address and password to log in. `[goto 2]`.
2. Home page
    + View current course. `[goto 3]`
    + Add new course. `[goto 6]`
3. Course page
    + View recent exams.
    + Create new exam. `[goto 4]`
    + Propose question. `[goto 5]`
4. Create-new-exam page
    + modal
        + title
        + keywords
        + time and date

        + -- modal completed --
        + -- n questions are suggested --
